## Password Generator
This is a hash password generator built with React that allows users to generate passwords of various lengths, with the option to include numbers and special characters. Users can easily copy the generated password to the clipboard.

# Features
Generate a password of any length (6 to 100 characters).
Include numbers in the generated password.
Include special characters (e.g., `!@#$%^&*-_+=[]{}~``) in the generated password.
Copy the generated password to the clipboard.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
